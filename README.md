# bookbot

This is a project build as part of the Boot.dev course. It's weird. It's now being used for experimenting, so it's about to get even weirder.

To run the script use the following input:
python3 main.py "path to text file containg book" (omit quotes).

Original README.md file contents:
# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
